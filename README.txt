In "Description (FlightsAnalysis).pdf" file I showed some examples of using Pandas library with Python.

There were given some air flights statistics for many years (shorten) and I tried to construct a price model 
taking in account frequency of arrival on time flights that should have ticket price little bit more (please see
task folder).
